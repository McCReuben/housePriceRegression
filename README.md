# Reuben's House Price Regression Model

My take on the classic Kaggle house price regression competition. I used this project as an opportunity to learn more about every ML algorithm and tool I could find.

The documentation in this repo is a bit messy, but here is a directory of all the tools I became familiar with during this process:

  - [Autosklearn](auto_sklearn_modelling.ipynb): 
  - [dabl](dabl_modelling.ipynb):
  - [pandas_profiling](main.ipynb):
  - [streamlit preprocessing](app.py):
  - [sklearn](main.ipynb):
  - [Models](main.ipynb):
      - xgboost
      - GradientBoostingRegressor
      - RandomForestRegressor
      - LinearRegression
      - Lasso
      - Ridge
      - BayesianRidge
  - [Imputation](impute.py) and [EDA](main.ipynb):
      - IterativeImputer, SimpleImputer, KNNImputer, MissingIndicator
      - LabelEncoder, OneHotEncoder
  - [pycaret](pycaret_modelling.ipynb)
  - [pipelines](pipeline.ipynb)
